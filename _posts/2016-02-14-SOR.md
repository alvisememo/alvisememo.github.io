title:  "Statistical Outlier Removal"

Hello, as I often manage 3D point clouds, I find often helpful
applying a statistical outlier removal filter (SOR) as the one
found in the famous PCL libraries, so I'm posting here a function
I wrote some time ago for doing just this.

Parameters:
* p: a vector of 3d points, which must be in float precision.
* nn -> Nearest Neighbor to be computed
* std_threshold -> the multiplication factor of the standard deviation
* app_steps -> number of time that the filter must run, useful when
dealing with very noisy data (use a high threshold and repeat the
filter multiple times)
* exact -> whether or not the computation of nearest neighbor must be
perfect or can be done with the FLANN library (thus obtaining a huge speed up)
* flann_checks -> number of time the flann routine will check to be
in the right path: it can be used as a parameter to improve the results
of the nearest neighbor, that is not exact most of the time.

Output:
* a vector of boolean indicating whether or not a point is an outlier
(it is when the corresponding boolean value is FALSE)

Iâ€™ve run the code for various amount of points, finding out that with the
predefined variables (1 filter step and 160 as a flann_check), when having
less than 1400 points, the exact option gives best speed performance and
assures a better solution.

```c++
std::vector<bool> SOR(std::vector<cv::Point3f> p, int nn, double std_threshold, int app_steps = 1, bool exact = true, int flann_checks = 160)
{
    std::vector<bool> ret(p.size());
    std::vector<float> dist1(p.size());
    std::vector<float> dist2(p.size());
    
    std::vector<int> indices(nn + 1);
    std::vector<float> distances(nn + 1);
    cv::Mat point(1, 3, CV_32FC1);
    
    cv::flann::Index kd_tree(cv::Mat(p).reshape(1), cv::flann::KDTreeIndexParams(), cvflann::FLANN_DIST_L2);
    
    if (exact)
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < p.size(); i++)
        {
        ret[i] = true;
    
            for (int j = 0; j < p.size(); j++)
            {
                if (j == i)
                    dist2[j] = 0.0f;
                else
                    dist2[j] = cv::norm(p[i] - p[j]);
            }
            
            std::sort(dist2.begin(), dist2.end());
            
            dist1[i] = 0.0;
            for (int j = 1; j < nn + 1; j++)
                dist1[i] += dist2[j];
            dist1[i] /= nn;
        }
    }
    else
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < p.size(); i++)
        {
            ret[i] = true;
            point.at<float>(0) = p[i].x;
            point.at<float>(1) = p[i].y;
            point.at<float>(2) = p[i].z;
            kd_tree.knnSearch(point, indices, distances, nn + 1, cv::flann::SearchParams(flann_checks));
    
            dist1[i] = 0.0f;
            for (int j = 1; j < nn + 1; j++)
                dist1[i] += sqrtf(distances[j]);
            dist1[i] /= (float)nn;
        }
    }
    
    for (int j = 0; j < app_steps; j++)
    {
        cv::Mat mean_m, stddev_m;
        cv::meanStdDev(dist1, mean_m, stddev_m, ret);
        float distance_threshold = mean_m.at<double>(0) + std_threshold * stddev_m.at<double>(0);
    
        for (int i = 0; i < p.size(); i++)
        {
            if (ret[i])
                ret[i] = dist1[i] < distance_threshold;
        }
    }
    
    return ret;
}
